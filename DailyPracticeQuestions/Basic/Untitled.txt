communist procession you know kerala is
9:05
a communist state especially at that
9:07
time
9:09
and at that time
9:10
in the whole of india communism was
9:13
looked down
9:14
as somehow related to
9:17
rebellion and protest especially since
9:19
near calcutta naturalism was growing at
9:22
that time
9:24
some villagers
9:26
were helped by communists
9:28
the communists of the northeast
9:32
and
9:33
some of them turned violent like
9:35
terrorists they turned naxalites
9:38
now
9:40
in kerala there is no nuxellatism
9:43

10:37

12:37
he's suffering silently because of that
12:39
horrible thing that happened to him in
12:41
the theater
12:43
and that night he throws up
12:46
you know sexual abuse of children is so
12:48
horrible
12:49
and it happens all the time
12:51
it is such a criminal activity
12:55
and the next day the twins are in
12:57
supposed to be in their best behavior
12:59
but our estha
13:01
is feeling frustrated and desperate and
13:04
angry when sophie mole comes
13:08
the adults have told rahel and esther
13:10
you are the ambassadors of india
13:13
you have to be in your best behavior you
13:15
have to say how do you do
13:18
rahil refuses to say how do you do and
13:20
then amu is angry amu says i'll punish
13:23
you when i get back home why are you
13:24
disobeying me
13:28
adults don't understand children
13:30
he's undergoing so much trauma right at
13:32
that moment there's nobody to understand
13:36
sophie mall doesn't care whether they
13:38
say how do you do or not all these are
13:41
adult pretensions
13:44
and they come back home when they come
13:46
back home their servant kochu maria has
13:49
made a cake
13:50
saying welcome home sophie mole
13:54
rahil and i love her but all these
13:57
pretensions are a little too much for
13:59
them
14:01
and then they start playing together
14:04
that is the time when amu
14:07
gets interested in velita verita is a
14:09
very muscular man and he's very talented
14:14
she's sexually aroused she realizes
14:17
that she has desires
14:19
she needs a man
14:21
they meet secretly beside the meenachil
14:23
river
14:25
the municipal river is the silent
14:27
witness
14:28
to their lovemaking
14:32
and the
14:35
affair will soon be discovered it will
14:37
be a terrible problem
14:41
when it finally happens
14:44
mama chi is so angry with velita
14:46
velita's own father waliya papan is
14:48
ready to kill velita
14:50
because to cross the
14:53
cast boundaries it's like a sin
14:56
such a big crime
14:59
ammo is put under house arrest
15:02
she is so angry and she shouts at the
15:05
twins
15:07
and the greatest fear the twins have is
15:10
will we lose ammo's love
15:12
there's so much attached to a moon
15:14
they can't lose a moo
15:17
they can't see her crying
15:20
but that is exactly what happens to them
15:23
in a few days
15:24
that is exactly what happens to them
15:26
they lose a moo
15:29
so when amu shouts at the twins they're
15:31
so upset
15:32
they decide to run away from home
15:35
they already have a little boat which is
15:37
very dangerous children should not go
15:39
alone in the river
15:41
because the river overflows and it can
15:43
be very violent at times it's very deep
15:47
sophie mole decides to run away with the
15:49
twins
15:51
such small children they are
15:54
and
15:56
the boat capsizes
15:59
rahel and esta escape they swim ashore
16:01
but sophie mall rounds
16:04
velita had helped them with the boats he
16:06
had warned them not to take the board
16:07
alone but they did it
16:11
they don't know what to do
16:13
they go
16:14
to a house on the other side of the
16:16
river on the other bank of the river it
16:18

16:20
it used to belong to
16:22
a white man long ago

kari saipa
16:30
it is believed that the ghost of kari
16:32
saipa is still there in the history
16:34
house
16:36
the children go and hide there they
16:38
don't know what to do
16:39
they are so terrified
16:41
they didn't do it on purpose and who
16:44

16:46
in the
16:48
yard
16:49
nobody other than
16:51
velita velita is also hiding there

and at this time
17:00
baby gochuma and the aip family
17:03
